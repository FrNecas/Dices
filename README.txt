Rules:

You lose if you can't put away any dice and you haven't rolled a 5. If this happens you lose all your points from this round.

If you get 3 of x kind you get x * 10 points (excluding number 1 which is * 100).
Every other dice of that number doubles the points. 

For example you get 3 times number 3 so you have 30 points and you put away 3 dices. You roll them again and you get another 3 so you have 60. If you roll another 3 you will have 120.

If you roll 1 you have to put it away and it counts for 10.
If you roll less than 3 times number 5 you can decide not to put it away.

If you get a row (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) you get 100 points.

If you put away all dices you keep the points and roll again with 6 dices.

At any point you can decide to stop and keep your points.
