# Dices

Game of dices based on the rules of our family.

### Rules:

You lose if you can't put away any dice and you haven't rolled a 5. If this happens you lose all your points from this round.

If you get 3 of x kind you get x * 10 points (excluding number 1 where the multiplier is 100).
Every other dice of that number doubles the points. 

For example, when you roll 3 times number 3, you obtain 30 points and you put away the 3 dices. You roll the remaining dices again and you roll another 3 which gets you extra 30 points (60 in total). If you roll another 3 you will have 120 points

If you roll 1 you have to put it away and it gives you 10 points.
If you get 1 or 2 dices with number 5 in one roll, you can decide not to put them away.

If you get a row (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) you get 100 points.

If you put away all dices you keep the points and roll again with 6 dices.

At any point you can decide to stop and keep your points and go on to the next round.
